Chrome extension to add prices from Tweakers on PCPartPicker, to find better prices for components for residents of Belgium and the Netherlands.

Only works on a parts list page. I recommend to use de.pcpartpicker.com or nl.pcpartpicker.com with this extension.

Only tested with Chrome but it should work with Firefox and others.
